# Niu-Niu-Simulation

The description of Niu Niu can be founf here: https://wizardofodds.com/games/niu-niu/ 
The code aims to simulate n rounds of Niu Niu and see the results. 
From the results, we can see that the final wealth of each player differ a lot, implying that you need to be 
"very lucky" in order to win this game. For simplicity, I didn't include some winning combinations of cards.
